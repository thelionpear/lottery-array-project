# Make a Lottery Game out of an array where if the same thing shows up in a row four times, they win
# and every time you hit enter it tries again 
# you should start with $25 and each time you hit "Play!" then you go down a dollar.
# if you win the lottery, you double whatever you have
# if you go down to zero it tells you that you have gone bankrupt 
# needs to puts "your balance" each time you hit play 
# in the first, basic iteration, you'll have a decent chance, but future iterations
# should skew the odds against four of the same coming up
